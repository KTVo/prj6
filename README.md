# 6.Project title: Medical Imaging database system/Second opinion
Description:  Patients  take  medical  images  such  as  CTs,  MRIs,  x-rays  from  different  medical facilities.  They  are  scattered  in  different  hospital  databases.  Create  a  central  medical imaging  database  system  where  medical  images  can  be  uploaded  by  physicians  from different  hospitals.  Patients  and  their  doctors  are  able  to  log  in  and  view  all  the  uploaded images. The system also provides a service to the patients to get their image interpreted for a fee. It should allow the patients to view a list of radiologists with their bios and give them an option to choose which physician to interpret their image.
